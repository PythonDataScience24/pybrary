# Project Roadmap

## Introduction
This roadmap is to show the progress roadmap of PyBrary. Note that while this roadmap isn't final, the repository's [project board](https://github.com/orgs/PythonDataScience24/projects/2) on GitHub will show a more up-to-date status of progress.

## Main Goals
These are the main features of the project that should cover the basis:

- **Task 1: Books Storage and Organization**  
Allow users to input and store books with details such as title, author, rating, genre and synopsis. Organize books in different genres, number of pages, topic.

- **Task 2: Book Search and Retrieval**  
Enable users to search for books based on keywords, authors or genres. Retrieve and display relevant books with their details.

- **Task 3: Data Visualization and Analysis**  
Provide users with visualizations of their book collection, such as a breakdown of books by topic or rating. Allow users to analyse trends in their book preferences, like the rating per author per year.

## Possible Goals
These are features we will strive for, should the main goals be completed ahead of schedule

- Allow intelligent addition/autocompletion of a books metadata through a database.
- Implement intelligent recommendations through said database.
