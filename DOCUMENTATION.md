# Pybrary Documentation

## Project Overview

Pybrary is a library management system with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to manage their collection of books. Users can enter book details such as title, author, year, pages, rating, and save them into a `.csv` file. The GUI displays a list of all books added to the `.csv` file and includes features for searching and visualizing data.

### Features

- **Book Management**: Add, delete, and search for books.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize book data by topic, author, rating, trends, and more using Matplotlib.
